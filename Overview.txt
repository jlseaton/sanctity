- Emphasis on story, with user choices impacting different results
- Firm delineations between good and evil
- Fun combat, in the spirit of D&D
- D&D style character progression, with towns/merchants, merchants
 
- Touchable objects in 2d field view that can progress/trigger storyline events
- Dim/Bright lighting and effects
- Background music, ambient and action sound effects
- Cinematic/story telling cut scenes for major plot points
- Long and short term Weather and events

- Radial flyouts for attack/spell/action selections

- Elemental magic emphasis and rewarding of correct identification of when to use which
- Types of attacks based on opponents and rewarding of using more effective methods
- Tactile / timing needed for traps and chests
